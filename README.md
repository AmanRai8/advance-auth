Welcome to **Advance Auth** ‚Äî a complete, secure, and scalable **authentication system** built with the popular **MERN stack**:

- **M**ongoDB for data storage
- **E**xpress.js for backend API
- **R**eact.js for frontend UI
- **N**ode.js runtime environment

This project demonstrates a robust authentication flow including signup, email verification, login, password reset, and protected routes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project uses [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for email testing in a sandbox environment. Due to Mailtrap's demo domain sending limits, **this project is not publicly deployed**. It's intended primarily for local development and learning purposes.
